## Rainbow Gallery

A simple web application that utilizes the Unsplash.com API

My first front and back end project developed to learn REST api practices, and built over 3 days,

- This app was created in order to learn full CRUD functionality, and therefore does not utilize a database. The temporary nature of the information was utilized in concept development to make a comparison to the end product and naturally occuring rainbows.

### Image Browsing

-Randomization of results from a query using buttons in the colors of the rainbow
-Users can save images as they come across them, and they are then tagged with the color used for the query and stored in the server

### Gallery

-The images are then mapped over and rendered in a gallery with the ability to change the color tag and delete the imae.
